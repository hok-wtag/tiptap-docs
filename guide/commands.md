# Commands
Whenever you want to change something on your document, you have to run a command. For example this can be for converting a paragraph to a headline, inserting images or undoing your last changes.

Mostly you'll run commands within a [menu](menus.md). Otherwise all commands are accessible under `editor.commands`.
